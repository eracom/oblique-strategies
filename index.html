Oblique Strategies
Over one hundred worthwhile dilemmas
Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt
Fifth, again slightly revised edition, 2001
©1975 Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt
-->

<!-- 
These cards evolved from seperate observatiosn of the 
principles underlying what we were doing. Sometimes they were 
recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition),
sometimes they were identified as they were happening,
sometimes they were formulated.
They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being
continuously reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from
the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation.
In this case the card is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite
unclear. They are not final, as new ideas will present themselves, 
and others will become self-evident.
